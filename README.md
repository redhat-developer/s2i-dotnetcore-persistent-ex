# .NET Core Sample App for OpenShift

This repository contains an example .NET Core application that can be deployed on OpenShift.

The example is a simple CRUD web application that persists information in a database.

The example is meant to be built and run with the [s2i-dotnetcore](https://github.com/redhat-developer/s2i-dotnetcore) builder
images. The branches of this repository correspond to versions of the s2i-dotnetcore images.

# Deploying the application

## Deploy using the OpenShift client ('oc')

```sh
# Create a new OpenShift project
$ oc new-project mydemo

# Add the database
$ oc new-app postgresql-ephemeral

# Add the .NET Core application
$ oc new-app dotnet:5.0-ubi8~https://github.com/redhat-developer/s2i-dotnetcore-persistent-ex#dotnet-5.0 --context-dir app

# Add envvars from the the postgresql secret, and database service name envvar.
$ oc set env dc/s2i-dotnetcore-persistent-ex --from=secret/postgresql -e database-service=postgresql

# Make the .NET Core application accessible externally and show the url
$ oc expose service s2i-dotnetcore-persistent-ex
$ oc get route s2i-dotnetcore-persistent-ex
```

## Deploy using the OpenShift Do ('odo')

```sh
# Use git to check out the .NET Core application
$ git clone https://github.com/redhat-developer/s2i-dotnetcore-persistent-ex
$ cd s2i-dotnetcore-persistent-ex/app
$ git checkout dotnet-5.0

# Create a new OpenShift project
$ odo project create mydemo

# Add the database
$ odo service create postgresql-ephemeral

# Add a component for the .NET Core application
$ odo create dotnet:5.0-ubi8

# Make the .NET Core application accessible externally
$ odo url create

# Deploy the application
$ odo push

# Link the .NET Core application to the database
$ odo link postgresql-ephemeral
```
